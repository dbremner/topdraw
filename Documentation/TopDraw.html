<h1>Introduction</h1>
Top Draw is a program that will run a JavaScript based script to create an image
that can be set as the Desktop Picture.  Scripts can be downloaded or created and placed
in a common folder on your computer.  Several example scripts are included with
the application disk image.
<p>
The application runs as a Status Item, which means that there is no front window
or icon in the dock.  Instead, there will be a colored shape in the menu bar to indicate the
current status (idle or rendering).  If you click on the item, it will display
a menu similar to this menu:
<p>

<table class="Menu" border="1">
<tr>
<th class="Menu">Menu Item</th>
<th class="Menu">Description</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="MenuItem">About...</td>
<td class="Menu">Version and other details</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="MenuItem">Render</td>
<td class="Menu"> If you select just the menu item, it will
render the currently active script (as shown below this item).  Otherwise, you can
choose another item from the popup menu list.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="MenuItem" style="color: gray;">Render...</td>
<td class="Menu"> The name of the currently
active script and the remaining time until it is rendered is listed.  In this example,
the Top Draw Script "Nodes" will be rendered and installed as your desktop in about 4 minutes.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="MenuItem">Preferences...</td>
<td class="Menu"> Set the script, update interval, etc. as described below.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="MenuItem">Launch&nbsp;Editor</td>
<td class="Menu"> If you've installed the 
<a href="TopDrawEditor.html">Top Draw Editor</a>, this menu item will be shown.  When chosen,
it will launch the editor with the currently active script.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="MenuItem">Quit</td>
<td class="Menu">Quit Top Draw.</td>
</tr>
